## This library is under construction and is not ready for prime-time just yet. ðŸš§


### Why the name Virgil?
Virgil was an ancient Roman poet who composed an epic poem about Cassandra and so we thought it would be appropriate.

### Inspiration
We were heavily inspired by Doobie, Cassandra4IO and Quill and wanted a more native ZIO solution for Cassandra focused
on ergonomics, ease of use and performance (compile-time and runtime).
